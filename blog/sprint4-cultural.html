              <p><b>Discuss how understanding the principals of neuroplasticity benefits people</b></p>
                <p>Neuroplasticity is the brains ability to change with exposure to experiences.With practise, new pathways can be created and improved to result in changes. Thinking about something can help practise and improve skill level. Knowing that you can change can help you change.           </p>
              <p><b>Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</b></p>
                <p>Whenever I get stuck or find something hard, knowing that with practise i can make changes because I am exposing my brain to experiences and that can change in the long term.
                    Repeatedly practising will result in changes to my brain - creating a solid roadway for the cars. 
                    Without using the pathways, they will begin to disappear.</p>
            <p>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Repeated practise, and using the pathways learnt. </li>  
                <li> Putting information in context, such as relating it to a similar idea or skill.</li>  
                <li> Make use of existing pathways to build strong roads. </li>    
                </ul>

                <p><b>Growth Mindset : Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</b></p>
                <p>Growth mindset is the thought that you can change yourself through development. 
                    Knowing that you’re not stuck that way can encourage attempts to change.Understanding that you can change the way your brain works can help improve learning ability. Growth mindsets allow for growth in a person and how they do things. By looking at things as learning opportunities, the growth of a person can continue. Taking on challenges, sticking with something when it becomes hard or when an obstacle is in the ay, putting in effort - nothing will happen without effort - taking onboard criticism, not personally but identifying it as specific to the task/skill at hand that can be studied/learnt/changed, and looking to others to be inspired by their success not threatened. These actions will help develop a growth mindset in an area.
                </p>
                <p><b> n this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</b> </p>
                <p> Learning that you can have different mindsets for different things. I think I have a fixed mindset in some areas and growth in others. I can now identify a time when I switched from fixed to growth for one area as I practised and saw small improvements. 
                    Learning that the input of others can help develop the growth mindset if I’m willing to take on criticism.</p>
                <p><b> How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</b></p>
                <p> Being more open to criticism and knowing that even if I take it personally, I can reflect to know that the criticism was about that particular skill that I can improve. 
                    Persistence in obstacles, even if I’m struggling because I can reward the small achievements to see success and put in more effort. 
                    Be aware that I will become defensive in some situations.  </p>

                <p><b> Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</b></p>
                <p> Understanding that the brain is malleable and that each days practise will help can really influence my motivation to keep practising. I think being open to opportunities and seeing the challenges as growth challenges will help me. I know I will reach a point multiple times where I think I’m the stupid one or not keeping up with the others. I want to be able to remind myself of these concepts at that time.</p>
