            <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
            <p> <b>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</b></p>
              <p>To be working for an organisation that empowers women to go on adventures. My definition of adventure is the sense of adventure where people are challenged. I like changes, constant learning, and I know I want to be helping young women have amazing experiences. I want to use my skills to help young women get involved and break down barriers. I think my long term goal is to use my web development skills at a business or organisation that does this. I don’t have a specific avenue to web development to focus on yet.</p>

          <p>Ethics - making moral decisions are important to me.I’ll actively oppose an unethical decision or ask to address the situation in a broader sense. I like rules if they make sense to me.
            Health - proactively looking after my health by exercising, addressing my mental health, and eating well. Health feeds into all of my choices.
