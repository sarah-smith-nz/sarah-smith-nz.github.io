            <h2>Reflection on Core Learnings</h2>
            <p> <b>Utilising your journal findings and the high level overview of the Core learnings you have covered in Foundations - answer each of the following questions:</b></p>
            <p><b>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</b>
            <p>I’m pretty strict on myself. I don’t trust easily. My ego keeps telling me I’m not good enough and that others will judge me for my weaknesses.

            <p> <b>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</b></p>
            <p>To carry out meaningful work that aligns with my values: I see ethics as my top value and can see this aligning with non-profit organisations or social enterprises. I would like to join a group of people who do good things, focusing on full stack development and continuing to grow a skill set with programming languages. I do my best when I contribute to a good project that will help others achieve more.</p>

      <p><b>Describe your core personal values
        
      </b></p>
          <p>Ethics - making moral decisions are important to me.I’ll actively oppose an unethical decision or ask to address the situation in a broader sense. I like rules if they make sense to me.
            Health - proactively looking after my health by exercising, addressing my mental health, and eating well. Health feeds into all of my choices.
