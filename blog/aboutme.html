              <p><b>I'm about adventure</b></p>
              <p>Problem is I hate travel. </p>I hate flying, being on a boat, being on a train, and being on a bus. </p>
              <p>For me, adventure is more about the challenge. </p>
              <p>Adventure used to mean music festivals, event management, living off 3hrs sleep, and saying yes to everything. 
                 I've swapped the long nights and migranes to refocused my goals.  </p>  
              <p> Some days the adventure is going to the supermarket, visiting a friend, or answering the phone. 
                   Other days it's a solo four day hike, flying down a hill on a bike, or a walk up a local maunga. 
               </p> 
              <p> Coding is an adventure I've always wanted to seek out. I just never had the focus to stay put for long enough.  
              So I've prioritised learning something new and committing my time to this adventure. 
              I'm finding it quite the challenge so far and this blog is capturing that journey.  </p>
