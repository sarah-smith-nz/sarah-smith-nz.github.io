              <p><b>Describe your core personal values</b></br>
                <ul><li>Ethics - making moral decisions are important to me.I’ll actively oppose an unethical decision or ask to address the situation in a broader sense. I like rules if they make sense to me.</li> 
                <li>Health - proactively looking after my health by exercising, addressing my mental health, and eating well. Health feeds into all of my choices. </li>
                <li>Independence - I like to have a sense of security and control, reluctantly giving that control to others is tough as I value it so much.  My independence value has allowed for personal growth and helped me to make decisions alone. </li>
                <li>Adventure - I love mountain biking. I switched event management and music festivals for hiking and biking which aligns with my passion for adventures in both the physical and mental arenas.</li>
                <li>Determination - constant effort despite numerous difficulties - I’ve made choices to stay and challenge myself, like recovering from injury and choosing to stay in Christchurch during and post quake to deliver events. </li>

                <p><b>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</b></p>
                <ul><li>Ethical decision - Suggesting to share my full time role with a colleague. During level 4 lockdown I offered a job share situation to keep a team member employed during a hiring freeze. My values told me that by offering the job share we could stay as a team, keeping team morale high in a testing time. I would lose half of my income during a 3 month period but would also gain free time to ride my bike, focus on self development and spend with my partner. 
                  >I thought it was morally the right thing to do and even when questioned if I was absolutely sure, I stuck with the offer. The team stayed together and continued to work during lock down ensuring we all made it out ‘the other side’ in a positive mental state with an income. 
                </li></ul></p>
                <p><b>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</b></p>
                  <ul><li>I have a mixed culture, kiwi and bajan. I have parents who moved here separately in their early 20’s where they sought out  ‘family’ through common values and shared heritage. They brought with them their love for flavour, spice and a good party. I grew up learning about determination in success, just giving things a go, having the support of my family, and being open to an adventure. These are all things that I value now.  Exploring the unknown was a common theme with our camping trips around NZ. Being around older family members as part of our weekend family visits opened my eyes to health and how important it is to care about it when younger. My independence was fostered when I was young in the form of ‘if you try, we will help you’. It instilled an idea that even if I failed, it wouldn’t be the end of the world. Having the idea of making calculated risks while younger has made me more independent and adventurous.

                <p><b>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</b></p>
                  <p>Gallup strengths finder
                  <ul>
                    <li>Arranger - organise with flexibility, can determine how all the pieces can be arranged for maximum productivity.</li>
                    <li>Restorative - good at dealing with problems, figuring out what’s wrong and resolving it.</li>
                    <li>Deliberative - care in making decisions and choices. Anticipating obstacles.</li>
                    <li>Developer - recognise and cultivate potential in others. Spot signs of small improvement, and derive success from evidence of progress. </li>
                    <li>Relator - close relationships with others. Working hard with friends to achieve a goal. </li></ul>
                  <p><ul><li>Limitations: Trust in others is often hard for me. Because I am so independent, there needs to be a relationship made beforehand, and without it it’s really tough for me to continue working with them. 
                  Addictive personality streaks seen with seeking adventure. Always wanting to have the excitement can lead to moving onto the new exciting thing before finishing what I started. 
                  Going after goals that I don’t actually want resulting in achieving but not being satisfied with the outcome because it actually wasn’t what I wanted. 
                  Avoiding conflict. I favour communicating via writing to pre-empt any conflict as I don’t feel confident in my ability to address conflict at the time. 
                </li></ul></p> 
                <p><b> Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</b>
                  <ul><li>I got bored at highschool and during my experience at university. I spent more time focusing on the nightlife which took me down the event management path. 
                  Strengths that I have fit really well with my career so far but I feel I was seeking a goal I didn’t want. I grew away from seeking adventure in music festivals and student events while trying to continue in more corporate event management. It removed the fun and even though it used my strengths it brought out more of my limitations. 
                  I think looking at my strengths and seeing what “thinking like a programmer” is, I see a lot of alignment in what my strengths are and what is needed in this industry. 
                </li></ul> </p> 
                <p><b>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</b>
                  <ul><li>All of my strengths: they are my strengths and I should be using them to my advantage. 
                  Obstacles are problems that just need solving. Seeing all the pieces, figuring out what's wrong, arranging them to solve problems. Doing things deliberately like noting the learning objectives and purposefully setting out to understand them.
                  Anticipating obstacles has already helped me in my learning by knowing where I might find sticking points and addressing them before starting. 
                  Celebrating small improvements and deriving success from understanding a learning objective. 
                  Close relationships with others. It sounds like we're all opening up a lot during this course and I think working with people who I might consider friends will really motivate me to keep going. 
                </li></ul></p>
                <p><b>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Example: working to evaluate an event. Resistance on agreeing it was a good event because the event owners believed it wasn’t. </li>
                    <li>Strategies: asking why they thought that, providing evidence/data to suggest it was a success based on the objectives set originally. Asking for a response to the data provided. </li>
                    <li>Effectiveness: a middle ground was found when we discussed their concerns on why the event wasn’t good. Agreement was made on the data supporting one side of the experience. </li>
                    <li>Other strategies: remove my emotion from the conversation. I took the disagreement personally, as a reflection of my standard of work. Once their concerns were addressed, the whole thing settled back down. 
                </li></ul></p>
