              <p><b>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</b></p>
                <p>To be working for an organisation that empowers women to go on adventures. My definition of adventure is the sense of adventure where people are challenged. I like changes, constant learning, and I know I want to be helping young women have amazing experiences. I want to use my skills to help young women get involved and break down barriers. I think my long term goal is to use my web development skills at a business or organisation that does this. 
                I don’t have a specific avenue to web development to focus on yet.

              <p><b>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</b>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Arranger - I organise learning material when I’m ready to tackle it. This allows me to see all the pieces, and how they might fit together.  A limitation with this is missing pieces, which can leave a hole and hampen the rest of the pieces making sense. </li>
                  <li>Restorative - I’m good at taking a process driven approach to problem solving. Limitations come with getting stuck with what the problem actually is, or what could be the solution. </li>
                  <li>Deliberative - I take care in my decision making and anticipate obstacles. Limitations come with taking too long to make a decision so making a time limit often works really well. </li>
                  <li>Developer - I can spot small signs of improvement which motivates me to continue on a project. If those signs of improvement are not being seen my motivation can wane.</li>
                  <li>Relator - I like to form close relationships with others to ensure none of it is superficial. This can help if I’m in a group or pair working towards a project if we can create a good relationship. It can be detrimental if I don’t make forming those relationships a priority for me.
              </li>
            </ul></p>
                <p><b>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</b></p>
                 <p><ul><li>Communication </li>
                    <li>Empathy</li>
                    <li>Patience and trust</li>
                    <li>Negotiation</li></ul>
                  </p>
                <p><b>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</b>
                </p>
                <p>My productivity is driven by taking the first step. I ensure I open my laptop by 9am each day I’m working. I address the learning objectives and use the timebox to see what’s planned for the week. Then divide that up within my time. 
                  Working safely looks like being respectful to others by listening to their thoughts and opinions, engaging with them online and in person, and addressing anything that doesn’t feel right.</p>
                  <p>When things are building up and starting to get to me I will breath and make a list. Prioritising what my must do’s are and making a plan. I have scheduled my checkin for Tuesdays to ensure I can address questions and keep moving forward. </p>
                  <p><b>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</b>
                    <p>Knowing that I can message on slack is how I will seek help. I will give myself a decent amount of time to figure things out on my own. If it carries on from morning to afternoon, or afternoon to another day I will seek help then. 
                    </p>
                <p><b>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</b></p>
                  <p>Guidance towards the solution, rather than the solution itself. Someone to share my thoughts with on my learning journey along the way. </p>
                  <p><b>Other commitments </b></p>
                  <p>I don’t have any traditional commitments like a job or kids. I will be making time for mountain biking, spending time with family, and spending time with my fiance.</p>
                  </p>
