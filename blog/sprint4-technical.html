              <h4>Two stories of problem solving</h4>
                <p>
                    Here's a time I got blocked on a simple problem and a time I solved a problem in an elegant way. 
                    <h4>-Getting stuck, like really stuck</h4>
                </p>
                <p> 
                    I was trying to learn a new built in method  <i>.find()</i> ]in the JavaScript language, somewhat like how you would learn how to use a new word in a sentence. I knew what the word itself meant, but not how to use it. It seemed easy enough to look up how to use the method. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    I first reflected on the instructions of the task: what was it really asking me to do? I tried to write this as pseudocode (comments that tell me how I want the code to eventually look without all the technical stuff).  Then I googled .find(), to try and understand how to use it. Once I was comfortable with that, I tried to use the method. I tried multiple different ways, and none of them worked. This was frustrating. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I read the error message. That didn’t really help. I tried to put brackets in different places. Tried reorganising the order of my code. Tried to look for more examples of how to use the method on google. This was annoying now. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I asked for help. I asked my peers what I had missed in this exercise. The tests were not returning enough information for me to make another attempt. This initially make me feel stupid, like why i couldn’t I make sense of this question and answer. When they responded and offered ideas, it helped me to think for myself by adding a different perspective. They also offered some reassurance that they had found it hard as well.                
                </p>
                <p> 
                    They were super helpful. They helped me understand I needed another part to make the method work (a function), and they also helped me understand I needed to think about what would happen if I couldn’t find the thing I was looking for. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learnt that I’m too proud to ask for help but that was really the turning point for me. It opened up alternatives that I understood which reassured me I knew enough about what I was trying to achieve to keep trying. 
                </p>
                    <h4> -Solved a problem elegantly</h4>
                <p>
                    The task was to take a sentence and put it through a function to return the whole sentence backwards. The problem was that I thought I knew how to do this with numbers in an array but couldn’t work out how to apply my .push method to a sentence (a string). 
                </p>  
                <p>
                    I spent a good 10minutes on this before re-reading the question and noticing the title of the exercise ‘reverse a string’.
                    I watched a video which helped me understand I could split up the word turning it into an array, which I could then use the .reverse() method on. I also forgot I needed to put it back together again, which I think I will now remember as a humpty dumpty situation. If I split something up, I most likely will need to .join() it back together again.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this I felt a little frustrated as I thought it would be manageable. I got annoyed that I couldn’t make my method work and then was embarrassed that I didn’t read the instructions well. 
                </p>    
                <p>I learnt that having a go with my own knowledge isn’t that bad of a thing but it is worth reading the questions properly to begin with. 
                </p>
                    
                <h4> How confident am I using the problem solving techniques and process? </h4>
                <p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>Pseudocode - I can use this in my own way but I don’t think my notes would make sense to others just yet. </li>
                       <li>Trying something - I can begin doing this when I start a problem but then feel like I need reassurance or ‘it will be quicker’ if I google it, especially if I’m not getting anywhere. </li>
                       <li>Rubber ducky method - I enjoy this. Trying to explain it to someone/thing else is helpful to me.</li>
                       <li>Reading error messages - this is hit or miss for me. I found some error messages really helpful, while others told me something I didn’t even know but did lead me to google to error messages. </li>
                       <li>Console.logging - I thought this would be my go to technique but with the kata so far I didn’t make use of it. In other problems I have quite a bit. </li>
                       <li>Googling - my favourite fall back method. It’s discrete and helpful - If I know what I need to find. </li>
                       <li>Asking your peers for help - not so confident on this but I gave it a go and it wasn’t so bad! Definitely on the last resort list though.</li>
                       <li>Asking coaches for help - last resort. I feel like I should be exhausting all of my other routes first. </li>
                       <li>Improving your process with reflection - when I find time! I did go back a couple of times to see how I did answer the problem, just to make sure it still made sense. </li>
                   </ul>
