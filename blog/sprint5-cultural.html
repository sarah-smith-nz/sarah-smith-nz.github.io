                <p><b>Utilising your journal findings and the high level overview of the Core learnings you have covered in Foundations - answer each of the following questions:
                </b></p>
                <br></br>
                <p><b>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I’m pretty strict on myself.</li>
                        <li>I don’t trust easily</li>
                        <li>My ego keeps telling me I’m not good enough and that others will judge me for my weaknesses.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p><b>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Values focus your attention - what you find value in and see as ‘good’ things so directs where my attention is in learning and what tools I want to implement during programming.</li>
                        <li>Empathy provides an outlook with patience and understanding, being able to put yourself in their shoes and see it from their perspective. If that person is me, then providing myself some slack and being kind.</li>
                        <li>Self awareness allows me to see what I’m doing and what approaches I’m taking, rather than just reacting. Seeing my strengths and weaknesses. </li>
                    </ul>
                <p><b>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</b>
                </p>
                <p>The importance placed on it in the course. I think just how much it’s broken down barriers immediately within the teams, and how comfortable I feel going into bootcamp with others - setting expectations on behaviour.      
                </p>
                <p><b>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</b>
                </p>
                <p> Commitment to new ideas. Committing to mindfulness, drinking water.
                </p>
                <p>Being open and honest with myself and sharing this with the group - and the world with the blog. 
                </p>
                <p><b>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</b>
                </p>
                <p> Because of the important role it plays in the workplace. No one wants to work with a dick, let alone be the dick. 
                </p>
                <p><b>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer. </b>
                </p>
                <p> Not at all. I have liked the balance, and have seen the benefit immediately with the new concepts and ideas. Something as simple as knowing we can all be good programmers if we keep at it, means I’ve judged myself and others less harsh. It’s almost helped to refocus my time when I am doing the tech parts so I am more productive. </p>
